# Urban Infrastructure Failure Simulator

This repository contains a research implementation generated using Chat.z.ai Agent Mode powered by GLM-5.

## Research Context

This project was generated as part of an architectural capability evaluation of GLM-5 in full-stack application generation scenarios.

The goal is to assess:

- Schema modeling depth
- Simulation engine logic generation
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Real-time update design
- Modular system architecture

## Project Overview

Urban Infrastructure Failure Simulator models infrastructure degradation over time and estimates potential failure windows for assets such as roads, bridges, and pipelines.

The system includes:

- Infrastructure asset management
- Rule-based deterioration logic
- Scenario-based simulation branching
- Risk scoring and threshold detection
- Budget impact estimation
- Geographic heatmap visualization
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Backend: Next.js API Routes (Node.js runtime)
- ORM: Prisma
- Database: SQLite
- Caching: In-memory module
- Real-time updates: Socket.io
- Containerization: Docker

## Research Objective

This project evaluates GLM-5’s ability to:

- Design relational schemas
- Implement rule-based simulation engines
- Structure modular backend logic
- Maintain architectural consistency across layers
- Handle branching simulation states
